Man muss sich aber bewusst sein, dass es dafür auch lauter ist. <br/>Check in und out war sehr einfach. Wir haben die 10€ Option mit persönlichem Check in dazugebucht. Pedro war wirklich sehr freundlich und nett beim Check in, jedoch lässt die Sauberkeit des AirBnbs zu wünschen übrig. Auf der neuen Bettwäsche waren überall Haare, in der Bettdecke auch. Der Boden war komplett dreckig, jeden Tag waren die Socken schwarz. Das Waschbecken ist undicht, sodass das Wasser in den Schrank tropft und von dort aus auf den Boden.<br/><br/>Die Wohnung ist nicht für 3 Personen geeignet. Es gab nur eine einlagige Toilettenpapierrolle. 1 kleines Handtuch für Hände. Das Schlafsofa kippelt und quietscht bei jeder Bewegung, ist eher nur zum sitzen als schlafen geeignet. <br/>Es gab für 3 Personen nur 1x Bettwäsche dafür 3 Bettlaken, und  3 Decken, aber nützt einem nichts ohne Bettwäsche. Beim Anruf in der Zentrale wurde einem nicht geholfen, man soll alles extra zahlen und es sei alles ausreichend da und 2 Personen müssten sich die Bettwäsche teilen und die Person auf dem Schlafsofa sollte die Bettlaken in Bettwäsche umfunktionieren. Was wir jedoch nicht wollten, weil dies unhygienisch ist und fremde Haare auf der Decke waren.<br/>Erst nach mehrmaligen Schreiben über Airbnb haben wir 1x Bettwäsche und Klopapier am 2. Abend zusätzlich erhalten. <br/><br/>Als Paar ist das AirBnb mit einigen Abstrichen in der Sauberkeit für einen Städtetrip zu empfehlen, da die Lage wirklich perfekt ist. <br/>Für 2 Freunde auch, wenn man kein Problem mit Bettwäsche teilen hat. <br/>Zu Dritt auf keinen Fall wieder.",de

Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo viaggiato molto e visto molti airBNB ma solo qui ci siamo sentiti davvero come a casa. Zona bella e tranquilla a 15 minuti a piedi dal  centro di Porto (o massimo 6 euro di taxi notturno). Facile e gratuito il parcheggio in zona.  La casa e' stata da poco ristrutturata, qualche lavoretto e' ancora in corso e ha diverse stanze in affitto ma  non ci sono rumori molesti perchè tutto e' nuovo e ben insonorizzato. C'è una simpatica gattina che ogni tanto fa capolino in casa ma non disturba e non si fa sentire. Le stanze sono nuovissime, con un design semplice, minimale e accogliente. La nostra stanza era sui toni del bianco e grigio con qualche piccolo tocco di rosso e simpatici cactus che animavano l'ambiente. Pulizia impeccabile ed ogni confort che ti fa sentire a casa: asciugamani morbidi, maxi doccia con vetro trasparente stupenda (non usciresti mai dal lì), letto comodo, simpatico terrazzino coperto con tavolino e sedie per guardare il cielo e bere una birretta o leggere un libro. Non si può mangiare in stanza ma negli spazi comuni che sono enormi e la cucina, nuova, è dotata di ogni confort. Internet e wifi alla massima velocità.<br/>C'è da sottolineare una cosa: questo spazio è stupendo soprattutto grazie agli host! Elena e Francesco sono due persone eccezionali: simpatici, disponibili, sempre pronti a fornire informazioni e attenti a tutto. Non vedo l'ora di tornare, consigliatissimo!<br/>In English: this is a home, not an house! The host are friendly and helpful people. You wille have a wonderful experience!",it

É um apartamento bem bonito, possui uma cama muitíssimo confortável, e tem espaço de sobra no quarto para guardar todos os pertences. O espaço do banheiro também é ótimo, mas a banheira anunciada está desativada. A cozinha é compacta, mas o suficiente pra se virar por lá também. A comunicação é excelente, e pra quem fica por mais de 1 semana, tem também uma senhora muito amável que faz uma breve limpeza do local e troca as roupas de banho e cama, se for necessário. <br/>A falta de iluminação e de ventilação no apartamento nos incomodou bastante, a única iluminação/ventilação vem do quarto (a qual não pudemos utilizar pois estava tendo uma obra barulhenta ao lado), o restante do apartamento é escuro, não possui janelas e a iluminação artificial não ilumina o suficiente o local. Isso pode incomodar bastante se você for passar muito tempo por lá, como eu e meu esposo que passamos 1 mês, pois dá a sensação que você está sempre na escuridão, não vê a luz do dia e o cair da noite chegar. <br/>Outra desvantagem foi a acústica do local, quando tem gente no andar de cima você escuta passos pela casa, e quando fecham as portas a porta principal do apartamento estremece muito e dá uma baita susto, sem contar que irrita um pouco depois de muito ouvir as portas batendo.<br/>Quanto à localização, nós achamos ótima, você desce a rua e está nas margens do rio Douro, local excelente para apreciar o por do sol. Com 5 minutos de caminhada você também chega ao supermercado próximo, e com 15-20 minutos você chega ao centro da cidade. <br/>Nós recomendamos o apartamento pra estadias curtas, mas para longas estadias faz falta ter uma área de serviço, como numa casa completa, para poder limpar os sapatos e passar um pano no chão, por exemplo.",pt

It is right in the middle of everything and you can easily walk to many sights and tons of restaurants.  The apartment is very stylishly appointed. The only negative of the apartment  is that it is rather small even for a couple mostly because there is no storage space at all.  Therefore, any luggage you have you will have to walk around or over it.  Other issue of historic Porto you should plan for is parking if you have a car.  Most parking garages in the heart of the city are run by Sobo and not only are they very expensive at about $30 euro/day but worse than that is that they only accept cash and nothing over a $20 euro note.

We also haven’t slept for 3 nights due to dogs barking ALL night and roosters making noise from 4 am onwards. We are therefore leaving our city break exhausted from no sleep. I think it’s important to let guests know there is no pool and noise from dogs is unbearable. Residents of this apartment block should be more considerate managing the noise of their pets.

<br/>
<br/>4 of us were attending the NOS Primavera Sound music festival, while the other 2 wanted to check out the nightlife in Porto.
<br/>
<br/>While it's about 10 minutes walk to Lapa metro stop from the apartment, once there you can be in Porto central in 3 quick stops, alternatively taking a (cheap) cab/Uber directly from the apartment will get you to the Ribeira area in less than 10 minutes.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is clean and spacious containing, a large living room/dining room, a large kitchen and 4 bedrooms, two containing a large double bed, one with two singles and another with 3 singles (we could really spread out). There were also two bathrooms which helped tremendously in the mornings when we were all preparing to go out.
<br/>
<br/>The kitchen was stocked with tea and coffee (a capsule machine which helped not being too reliant on coffee shops), some other consumables (bread, eggs & milk) as well as a bottle of port for us to all share (thanks Fatima!).
<br/>
<br/>All in all, we had a great holiday in Porto, attending the music festival, port tasting, visiting the beach, wandering around the river, checking out the food market and eating at the amazing Casa De Cha Da Boa Nova. 
<br/>
<br/>Fatima's apartment helped us feel more at home in Porto, and helped make the holiday a very enjoyable one!

I cannot thank Mirko enough.<br/>The location allows you to walk to the historic area (roughly 20-30 mins) or you can take the metro (10 min walk). I was able to travel from the airport and to the train station easily from the metro near Elis' place. <br/>The accommodations were very comfortable, very clean and the location extremely convenient; however, the best part of my stay was definitely the kindness shown by Elis and Mirko.

Porto Beach Apartment by LovelyStay,280564100.0,LovelyStay,2021-09-06,62403219.0,Mirjam,We stayed in this apartment for three weeks with our little daughter and her grandparents. <br/>Porto is a lovely city and has a lot to offer. The flat is in the most beautiful part of it and has almost everything you need for a relaxing holiday. <br/>We couldn’t get enough of the evenings on the balcony overlooking the sunset on the ocean. It was truly unique to live there. <br/>The flat is spacious and has a cosy interior ( which has been getting a little old and used over the years). The kitchen was well equipped and the layout of the facility is great. The bedrooms are very cool even on hot days and quiet. Sadly during our last days a club two houses away opened again after Corona lockdown and played really loud music that kept us awake. Only the bathrooms need more maintenance as the paint in both shower and tub came off and a little mold was visible. Since we didn’t want to bath our daughter in there the office brought us a baby bath which helped in that matter.<br/>Other than that we had a good base for various activities but would have liked a vacuum cleaner and complementary cleaning as we stayed for such a long time.,en

Charming apartment with a shared garden,10364726.0,Manor House Porto,2022-06-18,37074936.0,Karen,"Great location and a spectacular view. However, the accommodation is in need of a facelift and the pictures suggest it is nicer than it actually is. For example, the sofa in the lounge is covered with a throw to hide that most of the seat cushions/frame don’t have covers. One is just a dirty looking sponge square. This place could be amazing with some TLC and a bit of vision, but sadly I think the owners are resting on their laurels and it is being sold on the view alone. Top tip for staying in this central area is to bring ear plugs. In the summer it is too hot to sleep with the windows closed (there isn’t air-con) and it can be very noisy with street noise and seagulls.",en

The location of the apartment was close to many of the things we wanted to see and we were able to walk everywhere we went.  The apartment was clean and well supplied and the bed was comfortable.  The check-in was very easy and went smoothly.  The communication throughout was great.  The bathroom supplies (hand soap and shampoo) had been overlooked but were provided promptly when we notified the hosts.  The apartment is on the street side and we did not hear the train station at all.  There was some street noise, but only during the day.  The sleeping area can be closed off from the main part of the apartment in case one person needs to get up earlier or can't sleep.  I would suggest the guest check on whether the city tax is due or already included in the payment a day or two before checkout because it wasn't clear whether we needed to pay it or not.  The receptacle for payment is there, but there are no instructions.  We would certainly consider staying here again on our next visit to Porto and would consider renting from Porto City Hosts if we were looking for something different.",en

It felt authentically Porto and rustic: you walk out the front door to a cobblestone street and a view of a castle. The host check in and concierge services were a great touch - we got a full tour of the home and our host made sure there were enough towels and hot water before he left. He also gave us tons of recommendations and maps which led us to really great food in Porto we may not have otherwise found. The concierge service meant we could drop our bags off first thing in the morning which essentially gave us another full day of exploring. It's clear that everyone we worked with loved their city and were excited to share it with visitors. Obrigada!",en

L’hôte vous répond rapidement jusqu’au paiement mais une fois la nuit payé personne ne vous répond. Nous devions faire le Check in à 16h30 et nous avions indiqué que nous arriverions un peu avant entre 15h et 15h30. Personne ne nous a répondu. A 16h nous avons appelé l’établissement qui a son siège social à 300 m de l’appartement et  la personne nous a indiqué que personne ne pouvait nous apporter les clés.  Nous avons donc attendu 1h30 dans la cage d’escalier. Au bout d’1h30 la femme de ménage est arrivée sans trop nous calculer. Elle est montée directement à l’appartement et nous avons décidé de la suivre. Arrivés devant l’appartement, la femme de ménage chantait en nettoyant l’appartement que nous devions occuper. Nous nous sommes permis de sonner mais elle ne parlait ni anglais ni français ni espagnol. L’échange était donc compliqué entre nous. Elle a quitté les lieux à 17h ! Nous avons donc perdu toute l’après midi à cause de cet établissement. Nous trouvons scandaleux que le ménage ne soit pas fait à l’avance. Un gros manque de professionnalisme et d’empathie, l’appartement est pourtant très agréable mais cette situation nous a contrarié fortement pendant notre séjour !

É um apartamento de fundos ou de traseiras, como se diz em Portugal. É todo reformado e está bem decorado.

Não tem nem um kit de boas vindas, como água mineral no frigorífico. <br/>- não ter uma porta que separe o quarto da sala. Não recomendaria para 4 adultos porque não há qualquer privacidade;<br/>- para  quem aprecia um banho quente (no inverno), o apartamento não é o mais indicado porque há limitações por conta do reservatório de apenas 80 litros.

The downstairs has a larger TV, large fridge, cooking essentials/cutlery.<br/>There is a garage for parking a car and 2 bikes which are available for you to use (we didn't). <br/><br/>If i had to pick out some flaws it would be that it is slightly out of the centre, however this meant it was quiet at night and with a car we were able to get around the city without any issues. The car park slight squeeze to get the car in as there is a bit of a drive (10/20metres?) but you just need to be careful.<br/><br/>If you don't have a car, there are the bikes, as well as this there is a bus stop right opposite the flat.

<br/>Fernando의 집은 정말 크고 아름다웠어요! 거실도 침실도 화장실도 모두 넓어서 정말 좋은 집에 머무르는 기분^^ 이 집을 선택한 이유는 무엇보다 테라스에서 보이는 (대신 테라스로 나가야만 볼 수 있어요) 그 유명한 ponte louis와 도오로 강! 에펠의 제자가 설계한 것으로 유명한 다리죠~ 포르투의 가장 유명한 랜드마크를 숙소의 테라스에서 볼 수 있다니 엄청난 메리트! 
<br/>
<br/>Fernando는 정말 맛있는 포르투갈 빵과 와인, 네스프레소 커피, 과일등을 준비해주었죠. 덕분에 일행과 즐거운 시간을 보낼 수 있었어요. sao bento역과 bolhao역의 중간지점이에요. 모두 걸어서 7-10분이면 갈 수 있어요. 리스본 갈 때 타는 rede express버스 정류장(rede express garagem)이 매우 가깝다는 것도 큰 장점입니다. 트렁크를 끌면서 가도 3-5분? 완전 중심지에서 아주 조금 떨어져있지만(포르투는 워낙 다 걸어다니며 여행할 정도라) 치안 잘 돼있어요. 
<br/>
<br/>그림이 걸려있는 집이나, 깔끔하고 넓은 침실도 여행 후 피로를 풀기에 좋은 환경이었어요. 요리를 위한 모든 도구와 커트러리도 완벽하게 준비돼있구요! Fernando도 무척 친절했어요^^ 벽마다 난방기구가 달려있는 것도 좋아요. (집이 넓어서 늦가을이나 겨울에는 조금 추울 것 같습니다)

Liiiving in Porto | Cosy Experience Apartment II,30907275.0,Liiiving,2017-09-23,118238992.0,Darryl,"A group of eight 'middle-aged' (70's) seniors used Airbnb for the first time while traveling to Portugal and Spain. All  rentals exceeded expectations, but the 'Liiiving Porto' experience was by far the best! Abel was tasked by LP to shepherd the flock, and he did so with great enthusiasm. He even escorted the ladies to the local mercado to serve as their translator. He texted us daily to ensure that his flock was doing well. He is a great asset to LP. From our experience with the company and the way they treated us when our first reservation encountered an unexpected cancellation and subsequent rebooking, LP has shown itself to be great company to rent from. Should we return to Porto, we'll book with LP, and we'll be recommending them to our friends for their vacations.",en

One of the finest meals we’ve ever had. Jose was very helpful with transportation and recommendations. You must eat at Gazala and order the spicy hotdog and a Super Boc.  Sounds like nothing but it was fantastic. They only take cash. <br/><br/>Be aware of many stairs inside the apartment. Also outside to walk anywhere.

Tampoco solucionaron un problema que había con la cuenta de Netflix de invitados para poder verla en la TV. Son pequeños detalles, que aunque no son relevantes sí marcan la diferencia entre un buen servicio y un servicio excelente.

Cooled off fast, esp since it’s the top floor. Bed was super comfortable. It’s a little bit more firm than some may like but I loved it for my back! The shower was fantastic. Great water pressure, easy to change temp, and pretty large for Portugal. It was clean overall. We had a small cleanliness issue in the shower but notified Elena right away and she was quick to apologize and offered to send the cleaning staff over to re clean. Other than that, everything was amazing. It’s in a great area! However, there were always people sitting or standing in front of the entrance to the building. They gave us no trouble, but it was strange and occasionally made us worried. I think they hang out there because there’s a bar/restaurant across the street. There were seagulls mostly in the mornings making noise, but it was kind of funny. Didn’t disrupt our morning sleep because we sleep with white noise in the background. We would definitely stay here again! Great if you know you’ll just sleep and shower here which was all we needed!",en

Luxury Apartment Riverwiew Garden,27267172.0,Marcos,2016-09-19,5542351.0,Mandy,"This apartment was exactly as described and looked exactly like the photos. I suppose the only thing that was not clear when I booked is that the apartment we booked was one of 7 in the same building and sharing the same terrace. I knew there was more than one but not 7. However, when we were there this was not a problem at all and we were the only ones using the beautiful terrace that has spectacular views over the river. even if everyone had wanted to use it there was plenty of space and seating. 
<br/>It is a little way out of the main city area but we knew that and we're happy to walk 25 minutes in each day although there is a tram you can use. 
<br/>There is a good supermarket at the bottom of the road where there are also recycling bins which we also used.
<br/>Marcos recommended Graham's as a good place to try port tasting and the tour was excellent. It is a bit more of a hike to reach but worth it.
<br/>Marcos was a charming and helpful host and when we found there was no corkscrew in the apartment, there was one at our door when we returned from dinner. Excellent service!
<br/>There was modern quiet air conditioning, nice bedding and towels and just enough of the things you need like shampoo, washing up liquid etc which are the small touches we appreciate.",en

There are 48 steps up to the apartment and it is about half way up the hill from the river, so it can be a bit of exercise, but the views are worth it. Street noise is bad in the evening and in the morning--closing all the windows helps--but I slept well. The linen sheets were great. Compared to other Airbnbs we have stayed at, the kitchen was a bit light on ""extras"". Food markets were reasonably close and of course you are right above all of the Port tasting taverns. We walked everywhere, even out to the old fishing area on the Atlantic. Anytime you immediately start calling the place you are staying ""home"" you know that it is a good experience. We would stay there again. Oh--the free parking area is a couple of blocks walk, but was easy in and out. FYI, if we had not been traveling before and after our stay in Porto we would definitely not have had a car--local transport is easy,",en

A nossa estadia foi óptima, e o apartamento foi para além das nossas expectativas. Inclusive, forneceram-nos pequeno-almoço para os dois dias, já preparado na nossa chegada (inclusive forneceram-nos café, chá, leite e sumo), tal como todos os utensílios necessários para que não faltasse NADA durante nossa estadia, tal como, toalhas, lençóis, utensílios básicos de cozinha e de casa-de-banho, wi-fi, entre outros, basicamente tudo o que uma casa normal tem. O check-in e check-out dado à altura do ano (passagem de ano) foram bastante flexíveis com as horas. A Marisa esteve sempre pronta para nos ajudar e a responder a todas as nossas questões, sendo bastante amável em todas as ocasiões. A nossa próxima estadia no Porto será certamente neste apartamento da Marisa e da Sra. Beatriz! Não temos nada a apontar de negativo, pois estava tudo óptimo! O apartamento está preparado para receber 5 pessoas, pois tem um quarto e na sala consegue ter 3 camas, e tem 2 casas-de-banho. A localização do apartamento é óptima, pois localizasse perto da Rua de Santa Catarina e do Mercado do Bolhão, ou seja, facilmente se dirige a pé para todos os locais da cidade.

The position is really good, and late check in was fast and easy: the guy who welcomed us was kind, but we didn't receive any raccomandations on where to go/ what to do. The toilet is really small. I was really astonished to see that there wasn't even a bottle of water, and obviously no tea or coffee, etc. <br/>Overall it was a nice stay, but I'd say definitively not worth the price which is not that cheap compared to the average of the city (we also had to throw away our garbage).",en

Encontra-de de facto a 10 minutos da estação Campo 24 de Agosto mas acaba por ser num sítio que inspira pouca confiança. <br/>Ao chegarmos ao Airbnb, a chave do nosso quarto não se encontrava na caixa de segurança, apenas a de outro, que acabamos por usar para entrar. Contactámos o anfitrião que nos informou para irmos ter à recepção para esta questão ser resolvida com a pessoa de serviço e que poderíamos sempre ligar caso tivéssemos outro problema ou qualquer tipo de questão. Esta senhora além de inicialmente rude, fingiu que não sabia do que estávamos a falar e depois lá não informou que o quarto ainda estava a ser limpo….. depois da hora do check-in que constava na reserva. <br/>Enquanto aguardamos na recepção que o quarto estivesse pronto, a senhora de serviço mencionou diversas vezes a uns senhores de, pelo que percebemos uma empresa de alarmes de segurança, os diversos assaltos que tinham acontecido na zona. Como tal, a primeira impressão que tivemos da zona confirmou-se.<br/>Chegamos finalmente ao quarto e este não corresponde sequer às fotografias. Optamos por ignorar este factor visto que não tínhamos outro sítio onde ficar. <br/>Ao tomar banho, o poliban estava de tal forma mal vedado que ficamos com a casa de banho e quarto encharcados. Além disto, no final do banho a água começou a ficar fria.<br/>No dia seguinte confirma-se que não há água quente. Liguei ao anfitrião para tentar tratar desta situação e o mesmo, depois de se ter logo à partida disponibilizado, desligou a chamada e pediu que enviasse mensagem. Fi-lo e a mensagem nunca foi respondida. Liguei novamente e nunca fui atendida. Entretanto já ninguém se encontrava na recepção e não havia maneira de tratar desta questão. <br/>Há muitos sítios muito melhores e muito mais em conta pela qualidade do que este.

The master was great and equipped with a very comfortable bed. The location was perfect for our stay. We were a 10-30 min walk from wherever we wanted to venture in the city. The neighborhood was very authentic and welcoming. I highly recommend Fernando's place to anyone staying in Porto!",en

Easy communication in terms of getting in and out, and having a key code makes it easier so you’re not worried about keys. The Attic room is at the top and was very quiet. I didn’t have much noise downstairs in the plaza. However, there is construction as others have mentioned across the street, it starts around 8 AM just as an FYI.  <br/><br/>Also, you need to be aware of the gable pitched walls, careful with your head so that you don’t hit the beams as it’s an attic.  As a solo person, there is not an issue, however, I think it would be an issue if you had two people; a person could hit their head getting in/out the bed. I had no problem though. <br/><br/>It was very clean and well-kept, the air conditioner worked amazingly, and I did not get a lot of noise. Being the top room, I had lots of light.

Belomonte River View Apartments 1,79861584.0,Belomonte River View Apartments,2022-06-29,103620613.0,Matthew,"Amazing views of the Douro River with Porto on the near side and Gaia on the far side. Even though we didn't spend all that much time at the apartment, whenever we were there we were usually checking out the views, the pigeons and sea gulls, or the group of cats on the rooftops and patios below. The apartment is well located and easy access to all of the many sights Porto and Gaia have to offer. Mind you, 'easy' is relative here given all the many hills and stairs in Porto. We did not need to use any metro or bus during our stay but we did take a train from Sao Bento to visit Braga and we took a guided tour of the Douro Valley. The location is also good for finding places to eat, I feel like we could have stayed a month and still not tried all the many restaurants in the area.<br/><br/>Maggie was a great host and met us at the apartment. Even thought the apartment wasn't quite ready, she provided a place for us to drop off our luggage and gave us a quick tour of the apartment. She also provided a great overview of the city and marked up a tourist map with much of what we needed to know to get us started. We didn't have any issues during our stay but she checked in on us to see how we were doing.<br/><br/>We had a great time in Porto and enjoyed our stay at the apartment.  Just two things to note for future guests.  First is the half bath. I believe this was already mentioned but adding again here. It is just a toilet and sink and you literally have to go out on the balcony to access it. It was great when returning from a day of sightseeing and everyone needed to use the bathroom, but that was about it. Second thing was the amount of traffic noise in the bedrooms at night. Both bedrooms are on the street side of the apartment. I was surprised how much traffic this tiny street received and how late we could hear cars driving by. The cobblestone street changed the tire noise such that the first night I wasn't sure what I was hearing but was able to ignore it on subsequent nights.",en

Feel Porto Doc Townhouse,2228036.0,Rui,2019-05-13,45966983.0,Lynnda,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Rui’s apartment. It was clean, bright, newly decorated and centrally situated with nearby local shops for essentials and multi-hub metro station (Trinidade) only a few minutes away.  It was adequately equipped for preparing light meals, and we had a dishwasher and washing machine. Wi-fi was good throughout the apartment and the air-conditioning excellent.<br/><br/>The bedrooms were not large as each had its own well equipped en-suite bathroom with constant hot water and high pressure showers. However, some members of our party of six felt that the design, with clear glass walls between the bedroom and the showers, resulted in an inappropriate lack of privacy. A curtain or blind would be a great improvement. The beds were very comfortable, the pillows delightfully soft and the location of the building in a quiet area so our slumbers were not disturbed.<br/> <br/>Communication with Rui and his team was excellent. They arranged our transfers from the airport and at my request did a supermarket shop for us so we had supplies when we arrived.  The dining table had only stools and benches to sit on which were uncomfortable and gave it the feel of a school refectory so I asked for proper chairs which were delivered on the day after our arrival. They also arranged a late checkout for us as which was much appreciated as we had an evening flight home.<br/><br/>A small shelf in the shower for shampoo and conditioner would have been useful and the ladies in our party would have liked a full-length mirror in the hall but these were only minor irritations.<br/><br/>Porto itself is lovely and we hope to return with some more friends next year. We would definitely stay here again if the privacy issue in the bathroom could be resolved.",en

New! La vie en rose by Upperground,101542522.0,Upperground,2022-11-04,9079292.0,Shirin,"The apartment was alright for its price range. It worked well enough for the two of us, however there are a few points I feel the need to mention: <br/><br/>1. The shower is designed in such way that it overflows within a few minutes (maybe to limit water usage). We had to use our towels to keep it contained, therefore we didn't have any towels left to dry ourselves with. This is something the host should really look into, maybe the drains can be unclogged if they are. <br/><br/>2. No heating. We spend two days and nights there in November and it was freezing cold. The blankets in the living room suit to look nice but do very little unfortunately. <br/><br/>3. The kitchen was well equipped with what one would need to cook, even a sandwich maker, but to our dismay, we searched without success for dishwashing liquid and sponges. We could only rinse our dishes but not adequately clean them. <br/><br/>4. No rubbish bin/ or instructions in how to get rid of waste, unless we missed them somehow. In that case, it's our own fault. <br/><br/>5. Upon arrival, we found a negative review left by previous renters on the table. We were surprised to find it since the apartment must have surely been cleaned between guests. <br/><br/>6. The stairs could pose a risk to children but it didn't inconvenience us. <br/><br/>7. The lamp in the pictures don't have lightbulbs in them, possibly to cut back on electricity costs which only leaves you with a sterile, very bright roof light. Understandable to save costs, however items that cannot be used shouldn't bee in the photographs. <br/><br/>8. The communication was good and the hosts tried to help us find a parking spot for our camper.<br/><br/>I think that is all that was worth mentioning from our side. Thank you for having us.

FLH Porto Homey Flat with Balcony,3953109.0,Feels Like Home,2022-10-27,8576401.0,Ricardo,"This WOULD have been a 5 star review BUT:<br/><br/>I don't typically leave negative or critical reviews but given the potential for this space to be incredible, I wanted to provide some feedback... the space is actually beautiful and well-equipped (with a working washer/dryer).  It would be very easy to make this space 5 stars and an ideal stay in Porto except for the following issues that the MANAGEMENT company is responsible for (they should just charge a couple extra euros and fix/provide the following):<br/><br/>1. General maintenance/awareness of the space (the toilet seat cover was completely falling off, the soap dispenser for the sink was broken, a shower towel was torn, a chair in the dining area was broken and unusable).<br/>2. No shower soap or shampoo/conditioner is provided (if this wasn't such a nice place, maybe I wouldn't expect this ) - however, it is a very nice place and it's not cheap by Porto standards... this cheapens the experience at what would otherwise be a top notch/5 star place)<br/>3. While a washer and dryer are advertised and available in-unit, the company chooses not to provide laundry soap for guests - rendering them useless unless you spend the time and money to find/buy soap to take back for likely one wash?  Again, this just feels tacky and like cheap management... providing soap would hardly cost anything extra and guests would gladly pay an extra 1-2 euros I suspect).<br/>4. When I reported the broken items in the Airbnb app as required by Airbnb, the company replied telling me to report the problems ""to the team in Porto"" and forwarded a number. Again, lazy management - what they should have done was forward the issues to their team as they just as easily could have.  Also, as a protection to guests (and hosts), communications should be encourage to be in-app, not off the app.<br/>Lastly and perhaps the worst example the company doing what's easy for them as opposed to providing a convenient experience for guest: you have to go to a completely different place in town to get your apartment key BEFORE then going to your apartment to check-in.  Yes, that's right - you get in from your long flight and instead of going straight to the apartment in one Uber, you have to take two different Ubers (or walk with all your bags if you the apartment is close enough and have the energy), plus this adds 30 minutes minimum to your check-in process.  Ironically, if you get in ""after hours"" (around 5-6pm?), they will ensure you can check-in directly at your apartment but it will cost a fee of 20-30 euros or something.  Seriously guys?<br/><br/>These are things that are easy and inexpensive to fix or provide that would make the stay 5 stars, but instead the company is pinching pennies and guests are inconvenienced as a result. <br/><br/>I would encourage the private owner to immediately get a new management company (if you happen to be reading this) because this a beautiful space with so much potential.",en

PORTO  Loft with private parking &  lovely garden,47014420.0,Mr LEGRIS Julien,2020-08-28,156915491.0,Lisa,"Great apartment! Spacious loving area, lovely, clean bathroom with fab shower. The patio/garden is such a fabulous space, especially if you have children - just nice to be able to have breakfast outside etc. <br/><br/>Communication with the host was quick, friendly and easy and a late check-in was quick to organise with a small fee. Wifi at the apartment is also speedy.<br/><br/>We had a rental car so we could get out to explore beaches/ zoo etc. and the parking spot made this really easy! I had worried the car we had rented would be too big but the spot is large and so handy being part of the apartment itself.<br/><br/>There's a mini supermarket just around the corner (& a restaurant two doors away but we didn't visit it although seemed quite busy). The kitchen at the apartment has the basic amenities - oven, kettle, microwave, fridge/freezer etc. Could do with a few more pans/an oven sheet but we managed just fine. Having a washing machine was helpful too!<br/><br/>The location is about 20mins walk from the central Porto area which was actually nice. Gets the legs moving. Although uphill on the way back! Porto is quite hilly...with a pram you get a workout (whether you want one or not 🤣). We didn't use the metro but I believe this is close by too.<br/><br/>All in all a fab stay. Would recommend and would visit again.",en

The location was great and when we were lazy we took an Uber into the City center for 3-4 euros. It was super safe, Tomas greeted us with great hospitality and gave us a lot of wonderful tips. The only thing is we didn’t expect the house to be so humid and the terrace is a mosquito mine so we didn’t really get to take advantage of that adorable space as mosquitos love to feast on my friend and I. Tomas had told us about the house being humid so the dehumidifier came in super handy. We totally appreciated that there was air conditioning in the house for the same reason. We were a tad unlucky with noisy neighbors upstairs who walked heavily and came into the house in the middle of the night rather loudly but that is no fault of the Airbnb host and it could happen anywhere in the world.

Eugénia and Carlos could not have been better hosts and provided so much information on things to see and do and places to eat that it was quickly clear that we had not planned a long enough trip.  For those with cars, the indoor garage on site is excellent and the approach off the Ponte do Infante makes arrival and day trips in the region relatively simple.  Daytime traffic is very heavy, but the street calms down completely overnight.  Although slightly to the east of most sites, we were still in easy walking distance of many places and not far from several metro stops.  Plus there are many great restaurants and shops right in the neighbourhood - including a highly recommended place for francesinhas - plus a couple of grocery stores around the block.  Don't miss the walk down to the river in early morning to see a spectacular sunrise through the bridges!  The apartment is well outfitted.

PATEO LUSO - Cozy Apartment City Center,19531266.0,Tiago,2016-10-25,99213666.0,Yo Sep,"Before reservation there was a few review about the house, so I thought it would be like a gamble. After reservation, Joana very kindly explained how to get to the house. We used metro and walked to the house. It was not far(10-15 minutes on foot I guess) The house is like the dream house. It was really clean. Every appliance was there to cook anything I wanted. It was calm and cozy. I could see the street through the windows in the bathroom. Oh, don't worry about the privacy. There is a blind or curtain haha. There is a cute balcony where you can enjoy the calmness and the atmosphere of the city. You could have some tea or coffee there in the morning on a chair. The place was nice to go any tourist attraction. Joana told us the restaurants which are popular to the local people in Porto. I went there and the food was satisfactory. So you can also ask her to recommend some nice local restaurant. Inside the flat, there are two floors. On the first floor, you can cook, eat there or sit on the sofa. On the second floor, there is a bathroom, bed, table, and balcony. Ah, the closet is really really big so you can put anything! At first, I was concerned about bed bugs. But it was really clean and safe. To sum up. the flat is clean, safe, calm and every cooking appliance is equipped, and the water flow is good(of course hot water), and it provides easy access to tourist attractions and lastly but most importantly, the host is really kind and caring..and she is beautiful haha. If my friend or brother said he would go to Porto and didn't know where to stay, I would tell them Joana's flat is the perfect place. Thanks Joana! I enjoyed every moment in Porto because of your kindness and nice room. ",en

There were few minuses as it was very hot inside, but the temperature outside was 37 degrees, so if you are visiting Porto when it is not so hot there should not be such problems. The second minus is that the flat is a bit far from the city centre, it is about 30 minutes walking, but again, if you do not walk everyday or you are using uber/buses or other transport it should not be a problem at all. All in all the flat is 7/10, but it is also worth mentioning that Maria is really helpful and lovely person, who may help you with most of your questions.",en

Terrace Duplex in Porto,136571788.0,João,2017-10-12,20110201.0,Elizeane,"The location of the flat is great, few minutes walk to the metro station that takes you everywhere in Porto. Pedro kindly offered us an earlier check in since our flight arrived in the morning. He showed us how to get around and places to go and we've been to all of them! Thank you Pedro! <br/>There is a cafe below the building (Cafe Sweet) which is very nice and very cheap! We had our breakfasts there and lunch and the owner went an extra mile to cater for three people with different allergies/food intolerance. I strongly recommend having a meal there, it's simple homemade typical Portuguese food!! <br/>There were a few let downs regarding the flat but they can be quickly fixed: the shower curtain kept collapsing to the point we gave up trying to fit back; without the curtain the bathroom was flooded but  I guess you can live with that for a short stay (good shower though!).  The kitchen is great but there was absolutely nothing to use for cooking as in a bit of sugar/salt/cooking oil/coffee or anything like that. I am just mentioning this because we mainly chose AirBnB to cook at least 1 meal (breakfast or dinner) due to food allergies and at the other places we've stayed there was always a kitchen with basic supplies to cook or a bit of coffee/sugar/tea, etc. If you are like us bear in mind you will need to buy everything which wouldn't be a problem if our stay wasn't so short! <br/>I think the main problem was the sofa bed mattress - there's barely any padding and it is extremely uncomfortable. We are not fussy about mattresses when we travel but  I have neck issues and that mattress was a killer. My partner has no issues at all with back pain/neck but after 2 nights in the mattress he was in quite a lot of a back pain. It was quite surprising to see him complaining about a mattress! I hope they change the mattress soon for a more pleasant stay.  There few bits and bots that need maintenance but nothing major, more about the cosmetic side of the flat. <br/>Having said that, the flat is really nice, lots of space upstairs and there's a nice rooftop where you can have a drink or have your breakfast ;) <br/>Thanks for your help Pedro and I hope Joao works on improving this lovely place!",en

Bright2bedrooms apart. w/ parking option&panoramic,63061331.0,Mariana Costa,2020-01-21,33388524.0,John,Perfect for visiting Porto. Literally everything you need is 5 minutes away. Situated right in the heart of the city. The apartment is stylish. Spacious and well appointed. Great view out of the window towards the river and the South of the city. Comprises a long hallway leading into a spacious living room kitchen combo. Everything appears new stylish and of high quality. All kitchen facilities that you'll need including microwave and even a Nespresso machine. Two large windows look out onto a balcony that has two chairs and a table to watch the sun rise or set. From the living room there's a small anti chamber to the two ample bedrooms. Both doubles with new mattresses and pillows. Two bathrooms - one ensuite and the other of the anti chamber. Again both are stylish and modern and have power showers. When we visited all linen was provided and there was some soap and shower gel in the bathrooms. Tips - 1) for breakfasts go to Café Lobito across the road from the entrance. Open every day but Saturday and do toast to die for. 2) taxis are literally outside your door and there's a rank there that seems to be manned 24 hours a day. 3) Our local bar turned out to be Gazela Entreparedes (look on Google maps) so friendly and 1 minute round the corner. Excellent beer and their speciality is hot dogs that must be tried. 4) there is a lift on the first floor after the first set of stairs to the room on the left - took us two days to find 🙂. Other than that use the funicular to get down to the port area and enjoy the atmosphere and the port drink. Porto is a special place and Marianas apartment only added to the enjoyment. Thanks again.

Its central location offers easy walking distance to many tourist sites, a variety of restaurants and several small neighborhood grocery shops. <br/><br/>The sleeping loft provides a very comfortable bed and pillows, but be aware that it is reached by a steep quirky stairway. But since walking in Porto is a never-ending series of hills to climb, we counted that as part of the experience. <br/><br/>The bathroom and shower are small, but modern and clean. There was occasional low water pressure, but that usually corrected itself in a few minutes. The kitchen includes modern appliances, and plenty of new cooking utensils including some nice sharp kitchen knives (a pet peeve of mine).

Unfortunately, most of them did not reflect the reality: The toilet was leaking, so that the bathroom floor was always flooded. Additionally, the shower is so tiny, you can not even turn around. There is also no place to put your stuff in the bathroom. But the worst was the mould in the shower: There is a lot of black spots on the wall and especially in the corner. That is why we decided to call airbnb and left the apartment earlier to go to another apartment. The bed is also really bad, I am in my 20's and even I had back pain due to the old mattress. Another thing is that the flat is moist, so that the windows are always steamy in the morning. All in all, this was my worst airbnb experience.",en

Tuvimos muy mala suerte con el tiempo, por lo que tuvimos que estar en la casa mas tiempo del previsto, pero estuvimos muy cómodos.
<br/>
<br/>Lo único malo es que la calefacción es por radiadores y es complicado tener toda la casa caliente.La casa  esta divida en dos partes: dormitorio y salón (allí teníamos los radiadores) y por otro lado cocina y baño (dónde hacía bastante frío). También al ser el baño de techos altos (diría que unos 4 metros) aunque lleváramos el radiador allí no había manera de calentar el baño.

Overall, I would recommend staying here.  With that said, there were a few specific features that future guests should be aware of. First, the garage is almost scarily tight to drive down, with literally just inches to spare from the walls as you drive down to the bottom floors.  I ended up parking my car at a different paid garage because I was so worried about damaging the rental.  Second, we had repeated power (electricity) issues where the power would go out when we used the stove.  As I mentioned above, the hosts were very responsive and were able to help me reset the power each time, but this was certainly a frustrating experience. <br/><br/>The unit's location and size made it worth the stay, but the other considerations I mentioned above may be specifically relevant to some other future guests.",en

He clearly wanted to ensure his guests had a great trip.  
<br/>
<br/>Alfonso has done a lot of work renovating the space.  For us, it might have been better for a short visit, as the space and furnishings were basic and the space was quite tight for a 9-day stay, but it was clean and met our needs.  This tight apartment would be challenging for those with mobility issues or who have difficulty with steps, and might be a challenge for those with small children unless there were baby-gates for the steep stairways.  But the 3 bedrooms were a decent size, mattresses were comfortable, and the kitchen was well-stocked.  We were there in April, and definitely relied on the space heaters Alfonso had in the apartment.

Check-in was with Abel (lives in the adjacent flat) and he was accommodating and friendly.  I would stay there again if it was no cold out.<br/><br/>The flat was VERY cold.  I turned on the heater in the living room and the main bedroom (the only two heaters in the flat) to the highest setting and it did not heat the room for over 2 hours.  I literally had over 8 layers of blankets to try and stay warm.  There is no heat in kitchen, bathrooms or other bedrooms.  So if you come when it is cold outside, ask them to put the heat to 25 for at least 2 hours before your arrival.  If you will use the other bedrooms, expect to be very cold.<br/><br/>Issues that should be resolved<br/>- Bathroom tiles and ceiling need cleaning<br/>- The tiles next to the tub faucet is broken<br/>- Kitchen smells like mildew<br/>- Door in kitchen to laundry area does not close<br/><br/>He took a key deposit upon arrival, but we didn't discuss how to get the money back.  So you can't just leave the keys in the flat and leave, you have to arrange a time with him to leave so you can get your money back.   I find this a bit annoying when the ad says 24/7 check-in/out.  When I left Abel was not there, so I didn't get my deposit back.  He offered to meet me in the city to give it back, but I was already on the way to the airport.   I will just stop by there next time I am in Porto, but it is a waste of my time to do this.",en

It is right on the Atlantic Ocean in a beautiful walkable neighborhood.  Pedro himself was extremely responsive – he actually responded to me on Christmas day – and his apartment was well-stocked with local information, and perhaps more importantly, coffee pods.  Check-in was easy.  The space is about a 10-15 minute bus ride from downtown Porto, but as a veteran of city bus transportation, I would say the ride along the coast of the Atlantic and then the Duoro has to be as scenic as a municipal bus ride could be.  In fact, the hop-on-hop-off sightseeing buses take the same route and pass directly in front of the apartment all day.  I can not recommend this listing strongly enough; if we are ever in Porto again, this is the only place I want to stay.  I only wish we had been able to stay longer.",en

The bathroom and kitchen were equipped with everything necessary to make any simple meals. Though the place is advertised as self-catered, we thought it would've been great to have more coffee pods, sugar, toilet paper, and some cooking oil and seasonings (as for a 3-day stay it's a shame to have to purchase bigger containers of these items). The location was great, not only a 5 min to the subway but also 15-20 min away from most central attractions. I would definitely come and stay again and would certainly recommend it. If you're planning on staying in it's definitely worth it just for the outdoor space :) Thanks!",en

Attic suite with incredible view,29674300.0,Cristiano,2019-04-19,16669125.0,Michael,"Our two-night stay with Cristiano in Porto was delightful! The house is very charming, with quite a history. Our bedroom was spacious, and as most everyone else has written, gifted with exquisite views out its windows. We thought the bed and pillows were comfortable, as was the private bathroom, though located on the main floor, one level down. We also had complete use of the kitchen, with its Bialetti-style coffee maker - and coffee! Every morning had a great start because of that.<br/><br/>Cristiano is the consummate host, attentive of your needs, and allowing guests as much privacy as they need. But he is an architect, this house is his project, and he loves talking about it with you. Or maybe I should say we loved  talking about it with him. Delightful conversations!<br/><br/>The house is also in a great location, an easy walk to all the places we wanted to see in Porto, an extremely enjoyable city. We highly recommend a visit there, with a stay at Cristiano's historic house.<br/><br/>I would like to add one tip, a store in Porto called ""Confeitaria Dos Clerigos"", named in part because of the street it is on. It is a 5 minute walk from Cristiano's (location!), and has a sign in the window...Bifanas 1 e. That was the best Euro we spent!",en

The wood floor is a very nice feature and makes the places feels cosy and sophisticated. The bathroom has a window (big plus) so it benefits from natural light and the shower is amazing. Everything you need to prepare your meals is available in the kitchen.  There was some learning curve using the hob but nothing that a 2min YouTube video couldn't resolve:). Elisabete was an amazing host, providing us with a personal friendly check-in (thanks Eleanor), welcoming us with wine and Portuguese delicacies, and always checking if we needed anything.  Location wise it is very close to a metro/trem station with several lines into Porto (less than 5min) or to other towns such as Aveiro. It is also very close to the motorway. Threre is a LIDL supermarket distant 15 min (walk) and a shopping mall (which also has a supermarket) just one stop on the metro line. Great place to explore Porto by foot, metro/trem and to go to other nearby towns such as Guimarães and Braga. I could not recommend this place highly enough. I will definitely stay there again if visiting Porto in the future.",en

A Formosa - a nest made for two,185209.0,João,2018-10-16,47941048.0,Jebran,"""A Nest Made For Two"" is pretty accurate. My wife and I were snacks for some bed bugs here. Really terrible experience. After experiencing two restless nights here and a bunch of mysterious itchy bites on both myself and my wife, we found out bed bugs were responsible. The room itself looked okay, though a bit sketchy just because of how many other spiders and mosquitoes there were, but the sheets looked relatively okay. João was really friendly and nice altogether but maybe he's not aware of this issue. We only discovered it while we were checking out early morning. We had to throw out a bunch of stuff and spend a lot of money on laundry. But the fact that we got so many bites all of a sudden means that the bed bugs were probably there for a while...We had to wait a couple days to confirm but no new bites after leaving and doing a ton of laundry. We're still paranoid and checking. Hate to leave bad reviews, but this was a really painful experience.",en

We were also given towels and there is  shampoo and shower gel which is a benefit when travelling with small bags. The kitchen is very well equipped. Two sofas in the living room are a benefi when travelling in a group of three because when one is used as a bed, the other can still be used as a sofa.<br/>The location is very convenient, with supermarkets and cafes within 5 minutes of walking. It is also very close to the center and to the train station Sao Bento which is from where most of the trains go (for example for one day trips from Porto which I highly recommend).

Location is super central (although be prepared to walk up a hill to get there) and is ideal for anybody hoping to visit the majority of the city by foot (but there are bus stops and metro stations nearby too). Hosts were also really accommodating, arranging for an early check-in and late check-out. <br/><br/>As for the flat itself, the photos offer a really accurate idea of the space, and the beds are comfortable. The bathroom is small, and we found we had to hold the shower head ourselves as were worried using the stand would mean the water sprayed over the top of the shower doors. On the whole though this is really only a minor issue. As its a gorgeous old building, the walls are fairly thin so you can hear a fair amount of noise from the stairwell. <br/><br/>Overall, would recommend this property to anyone looking for a low-key and budget-friendly couple of days in the city, and I'd probably stay here again if I were to return to Porto!",en

River Balcony Downtown,12412664.0,Dolores,2017-06-25,48437257.0,Rachel,"This spot is perfectly adequate if you're just looking for somewhere to crash at night. On the plus side, you do not have to wait for the host to meet you, as the keys are available any time in a lockbox.  Susana, who lives on the 2nd floor, is friendly and helpful if needed.  Keep in mind when you book: it is a 5th floor walk-up with rickety old stairs and lights that only sometimes work! The apartment itself is quite old and has had no renovations done.  It smells a bit like an old grandmother's place and is quite difficult to air out because there is no cross-ventilation (unless you prop the doors to both sides of the apartment open).  If you prop the doors, make sure to carry the keys with you; the doors will get swung shut by the wind and you can easily get locked out.  The beds are passable, though the bedding is quite old and again feels like granny's old place.  The plumbing is old and you cannot flush the toilet paper, which would be fine if the trash cans to deposit it in were a bit bigger.  It's on a small (steep!) neighborhood street with neighbors that tend to stay up late and hang out in the streets, so it's a bit difficult to get a good night's sleep if you're not a very sound sleeper.",en

Charming Suite with shared garden in City Center,10364726.0,Manor House Porto,2015-09-03,24498694.0,Blakely,"My cousin Jesse and I stayed in the Porto Manor house for 3 nights. When we arrived in Porto we had a very hard time finding the apartment because our GPS couldn't figure out where the street was because it is in an obscure location. Once we finally found it Claudia was so sweet and helped us find parking in the tight alleyway behind the apartment. She also went out of her way to tell us so many great things to see and do in beautiful Porto. She gave us a map and pointed out key places to see which was so nice of her. The apartment itself is lovely but we wanted to share a few thoughts. The view is spectacular and the actual location of the apartment is perfect. Walking distance to everything. We loved sitting in the back drinking wine and watching the beautiful sunsets over Porto. The yard, however, was not very well maintained as pictured. As wonderful as the ancient stone looks it tends to trap in every amount of moisture possible. The apartment always felt very damp and had a moldy smell to it because of the trapped moisture. The bathroom never dried and our towels were always damp.  However, we overlooked the dampness because it was so charming to stay in a room with so much history. We loved waking up in the morning to the beautiful view of the Porto bridge but the bed itself was very uncomfortable. The mattress was incredibly thin and anytime you moved the bed made a very loud squeaking noise.

Alternatively, you can have the key delivered to you, but there is a 10 Euro charge for that. The apartment was spacious and clean. It's clear it had recently been renovated making it feel very modern. The bed was comfortable. We didn't do any cooking, but the kitchen seemed fairly well stocked if you're planning a longer stay.

We came in a rental car, and it was tough to unload in front of the building as the road was extremely active in the afternoon.    Luckily after circling for 20 or so minutes we found street parking.   (Noise isn’t too bad.  Can only really hear the construction if the windows are open.",en

<br/>The whole building has been recently refurbished to a high standard and the apartment looked as good as it does in the photos.  Although the bathroom is small its okay for 1 person to use at a time.  The combination boiler provided sufficient hot water for a shower, although the pressure was not equivalent to a power shower.  
<br/>
<br/>The bedroom is at the back of the apartment and quiet at night.  If you are tall your feet will dangle over the end of the double bed, and we found the hard mattress took a little getting used to.  For reference we have a memory foam mattress at home.
<br/>
<br/>The kitchen while small is well equipped.  We used the toaster, kettle, oven and ceramic hob during our stay and everything worked well.  
<br/>
<br/>The apartment faces north west so the sun only shone into the apartment at the end of the day.  This meant that during our stay the apartment did not get too hot.  The air conditioning worked well to heat the apartment on the few cool nights during our stay.  The Wi-Fi worked well in the lounge as did the small TV.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is well located about 5 minutes walk up a typically steep hill from Sao Bento metro station.  The old town and the main shopping street in Porto are both within walking distance of the apartment.  There are plenty of choices of places to eat and drink in the neighbourhood, including a few supermarket chains.  If you’re planning to go to Serralves you can catch bus 207 nearby from the bus stop in front of the National Theatre (bus stop code BTLH1).
<br/>
<br/>Fábio is a good host and exceeded our expectations in what he provided in the apartment.  The apartment has been recently refurbished to a high standard and its in a good location for exploring the many hills of Porto and Gaia.

Не однократно наблюдали что после выселения номера хорошо убираются, постельное белье и полотенца меняются. В комнате было достаточно чисто, за 6 дней никто не вынес мусор но наверное этого не предусмотрено за такие деньги и тип проживания, поэтому претензий нет. Хозяин очень быстро отвечал, сразу поменял лампочку в комнате как я сообщила что она не работает, быстро принёс фен когда я попросила. Большая кухня, хороший wifi в комнате, на кухне и даже во внутреннем дворе. Убирались в душевых регулярно. Стиральная машинка и сушилка бесплатно. Гости пару раз громко общались глубоко ночью и забрали наш шампунь но конечно хозяин в этом не виноват))) в целом за эти деньги достойный вариант, спасибо ❤️",ru

The 'secret garden' is a wonderful and surprising terrace, perfect for relaxing in after a day of sightseeing.<br/>There's everything you need for a perfect stay – and much more. Paulo has a fascinating collection of books and music to enjoy.<br/>The apartment is on the 7th floor, but there are two lifts, and it's very spacious and light. The advantage of being outside the city centre and tourist areas is that it's a lot quieter than many city flats.<br/>We love walking, and we did a lot of that to get to the centre and the river. There's a metro station 5-10 minutes away, though, with easy connections. We also liked being in a 'real' neighbourhood, where we could shop in non-tourist foodshops (including two organic places) and have breakfast in a local confeitaria.<br/>Paulo was great at answering emails and text messages quickly and he met us at the flat himself. A super stay!",en

Aida Duplex Apartment | 5 Bedrooms,541968.0,Aida,2015-06-28,25915417.0,Paul,"Aida was responsive, welcoming, and helpful.  We appreciated her communications pre-arrival.   Note that her unit is #104...somehow we were one unit off and met another neighbor.  No worries.
<br/>The unit was great, and accurately described.  We appreciated the balconies and laundry equipment (which was difficult to master...could use written instructions to help in using properly, however).   Thus unit was high enough off the street to be able to open windows without the traffic noise we encountered in other units.  The elevator was a must, given the number of stairs to climb.  The lobby smelled horribly...hope that was just temproary...while the unit itself smelled just fine.   We enjoyed the sunlit rooms, comfortable dining table and living room where we could eat, visit, or work.  Wifi was provided.  The unit was well stocked with everything we needed to live there for a few days.  Obviously, the owners cared about their guests. 
<br/>The neighborhood was middle-of-the-road, yet convenient enough for us to get around by foot or taxi.  We enjoyed Porto and all its delights. 
<br/>Thanks Aida. ",en

Apartment  Douro Ribeira Porto,6410302.0,Luis,2019-04-21,44034602.0,Elaine,"We booked this place based on reviews from others. The highlight seemed to be ""location"". Sad to say, there is not much else positive to say. We believe in giving honest reviews that will help other travelers, especially if you are coming from far away, as we did.<br/>The location is excellent. The view of the river cannot be beat. The bed (NOT a King as listed) was very comfortable but needed more pillows. Quiet at night except for other guests coming in and out. We found a newer toaster in the kitchen and 2 really nice wine glasses. The coffee maker was broken, we found an old espresso maker that had a broken seal and very stained inside and used that. The coffee cups were cracked and old. There was nothing to wash dishes with except a moldy, dirty sponge. BUT the water was nice and hot. The bathroom was very, very small and had nowhere to put your toiletries. The mold growth was HORRIBLE and unhealthy.  Nowhere to wash clothes, even though a washing machine was supposed to be included. No clothes pins to hang hand washing. This place  could be a little gem if Luis would put some money into it. Fix the broken floor instead of hiding it under a dirty rug!  He did respond to our request for hand soap and dish soap. Leaving some old soap that others have used in the shower is just  disgusting. The fan above the stove is broken also. Beautiful river front and watching the boats on the Duoro is magical.",en

<br/>The neighbourhood is fairly noisy at the moment but that is only because there is a building being constructed next door.
<br/>There is a great walking track along the beach (15 km) with some nice places to stop for a cool drink on route.
<br/>Good supermarket close by in a large shopping centre.
<br/>Freeway easy to get onto, to access other areas.

A beautiful park is just across the street and the frequent 500 bus will take you all the way to the historical center of Porto in about 20 minutes.

The air, especially in the morning, is filled with the smell of the ocean that will surely empower you for the adventures of the day, of which Porto has plenty to offer.<br/>The room itself was incredibly cozy and clean, smelling of fresh linen. Felt more like a 5 star hotel room than an affordable Airbnb location. The room has its own entrance with access to the street as well as a private shower and toilet room. You can bar the access from the rest of the house for extra privacy. There's also a fish tank to stare at to help you relax. Upon arrival we found cookies, tea and a small kettle to boil water with that our hosts kindly left for us.<br/>All of our requests and wishes were met with utmost kindness and keen will to help.

We had read airbnb reviews warning about the renovations so we checked with the host first who assured us the renovations were complete.  We had 5 days of noise and dust and on the Saturday when we hoped for a break the builders painted with a volatile solvent that made us feel quite ill.  I would suggest no one stay for the remainder of 2018 or get a guarantee of money back if the renovations are not complete.  Communications with the host were misleading at first and then when we raised the issue they said there is nothing they can do about it.  (They could have told the truth in the first place).

The apartment is spacious and clean, you can find everything you need in there. The apartment is quite noisey, it's right above a bar, so you can hear the bar noises quite good until 1 of 2 at night.

The location is great, right in the centre of the village, nearby all the shops, restaurants and bars. And near the train station (walking distance), it's super easy (and cheap) to travel by train to Porto. And if you step out of the apartment you are right on the beach! <br/>The beds are quite hard, but that's everywhere in Portugal I guess ;) and in the 'parents bedroom' the bed is quite small. For a couple it's fine but I was traveling with my sister and kids and than a small bed is not so convenient.

The two bedrooms are very large with individual sitting areas. The bed was very comfortable, and the black out shutters were perfect. There was some minor noise from neighbors in the stairwell, so light sleepers may want to use ear plugs. Having two bathrooms felt like a luxury in a European apartment. The showers are small (but standard for Europe), so larger individuals take note that you'll be bumping elbows against the wall. It was great to have paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, and plenty of toilet paper provided.  Luis provided some great recommendations for restaurants and sites.  There were a few stray hairs here and there in the bathroom, and it appeared that one of the toilets hadn't been flushed (though this may have been from the drainage design of the toilet).

Eventually, someone came by that evening and glued the doorknob and told us not to use for a few hours. That brought us to 2 days without the use of the bathroom.

The apartment is right across the road from the station, has a cafe at the entrance and is a short walk to the supermarket and town square. Fantastic location for sightseeing. Our only issue was the street noise. We had unfortunate timing with the university students having their big celebration one night and the football team gaining victory the next so we were kept awake with yelling and honking horns till at least midnight for two nights of our stay. Luckily our kids managed to sleep through it being in a room further from the street facing windows.

Un point très positif est que vous avez la station de métro Marquês au niveau de la jolie petite place qui se trouve juste devant la maison, de là , vous pouvez accéder à toute la ville en un rien de temps. La maison où se trouve l'appartement est une maison de maître , superbement décorée , à l'extérieur comme à l'intérieur. L'appartement en lui même se trouve au dernier étage de la maison ; il est fidèle,à l'identique,aux photos affichées , superbe petit appartement avec tout ce qu'il faut : wifi , 2 télévisions , machine à laver , fer à repasser , lave-vaisselle, sèche cheveux, air conditionné dans le salon et dans la chambre (le rêve) , la salle de bain est petite mais ma foi fonctionnelle , la cuisine comporte tout ce qu'il faut , le salon est cosy , le lit est super confortable , tout le mobilier est de qualité. On prenait le petit-déjeuner sur le balcon qui donne l'air de se trouver perché dans les arbres, super agréable. Il y a un supermarché ""Pingo Doce"" à même pas 500m, et le quartier comporte pharmacie , boulangerie , quelques magasins de vêtements... Si je devais trouver quelques chose à redire je dirais : L'arrêt de bus en bas de l'appartement où les bus stationnent parfois de longues minutes en faisant un peu de bruit, mais vous ne l'entendez absolument pas si les fenêtres sont fermées (quasi tout le temps le cas puisqu'on mettait l'air co), ah oui et aussi on a manqué de bols pour le petit-déjeuner , mais on s'est débrouillé avec des tupperwares ;-) . En bref : 4 jours de rêve , le tout pour un très bon rapport qualité-prix (hors haute saison, nous sommes partis mi-juin) et je recommanderai sincèrement l'adresse à toutes mes connaissances !",fr

Very quiet, comfortable bed and Yours Porto are very responsive and helpful during opening hours.<br/><br/>The only issue we had was that the airport transfer arranged for us took us to the completely wrong apartment in the middle of the night. It was only after trying the access code several times and attempting to call Yours Porto (no answer) that we realised we were in the wrong place. Luckily we had phone data and Google maps otherwise we would have been really stranded. <br/><br/>To get to the correct apartment we had to haul our cases up lots of very steep cobbled (beautiful) streets and several flights of stairs. Thankfully we are both young and pretty fit and could laugh about it but it was still a struggle. When I contacted them the next evening about this they said they were aware of the mistake but had not been able to contact the driver. I understand mistakes happen but feel that they should have tried to contact us or at least called us in the morning to make sure we were ok. <br/><br/>Absolutely great place though and we had a fantastic time :) We would stay again but will definitely double check the address with the transfer driver next time 😅",en

Muy cómodo si te mueves con coche y además incluye parking. El handicap es el hecho de tener que ir a buscar las llaves al centro de Porto algo que podría resolverse con un locker con código. Deberían escribirlo en el anuncio y no comunicarlo una vez haces la reserva.<br/>El barrio es muy peculiar ya que da la sensación de que es una zona en el que se mezclan ricos y pobres. Es interesante porque confluyen varios barrios algunos de clase alta o en auge como Lordelo do Ouro que parece que se ha revalorizado en la zona de costa y esa oleada parece estar llegando a la zona interior donde está el apartamento. El gobierno parece estar promoviendo esa gentrificación y quizás el apartamento es resultado de esa política. Por ejemplo, la casa está cerca de dos grandes supermercados (Mercadona y Lidl) que son de reciente creación (2021) como fruto de una política para frenar la venta y consumo de drogas en la zona (eran antiguas fábricas ocupadas por drogadictos). Aunque hay policía armada custodiando los supermercados es mejor ir durante el día ya que la salida (en coche) de los supermercados te obliga a cruzar un barrio de consumo y venta de drogas (Aleixo) que no he visto en mi vida. La gente parece muy habituada a ver y tratar con yonkis quizás por la política de considerarlos personas que requieren tratamiento médico y no criminales. <br/>En todo caso, la zona del apartamento es muy tranquila y parece muy segura. Es interesante ver también esa parte de la historia más reciente de Porto. Creo que es un sitio que vale la pena por lo que ofrece a nivel de calidad/precio siempre que vayas en coche. La comunicación con la empresa es muy buena y el único handicap es el tema recogida de llaves que deberían incluirlo en la descripción del anuncio",es

Kitchnette Studio in Porto's Downtown II,1651078.0,Lurdes,2022-06-19,68564036.0,Angie,"Its a lovely little studio, a green oasis, right within the city.  Basic amenities, like bus stop, supermarket etc are within reach and is within 15 mins walking-distance to the city centre.<br/><br/>Communication went smooth and special shout out to Aderito! He also had great recommendations for me and had been very warm and welcoming.<br/><br/>If you are afraid of dogs, its not a place to go because they own two dogs who barks up at you every time you walk in and out. I personally love dogs and never felt them as a nuisance. Besides, they are never near the accommodation.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great place to stay. I gave only four stars just because I found the rooms a little smaller than in the pics. Its perfect for few nights but not for longer stays.",en
